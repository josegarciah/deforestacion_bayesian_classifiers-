# A Hybrid Intelligence Approach to Predicting and Explaining Land use and Land Cover Change using Bayesian Classifiers
Christopher Rhodes Stephens, Constantino González-Salazar, José García-Hernández

# Abstract
The future health of land systems depends on our ability to quantify and understand
the causes of land cover change. This requires the integration of data of different types
and spatio-temporal resolutions and the creation of accurate, explainable prediction
models. To achieve this we present a framework where all variables are converted to
binomial form at the same spatio-temporal resolution, co-occurrences between classes
of interest, $C$, and a set of predictive features, $\mathbf X$, are computed and
converted into a Bayesian classifier $P(C|\mathbf X)$, where each feature $X_{ij}$ is
quantified by its effect size, coverage, statistical significance and potential causality. As
a usecase we predict deforestation at the municipal level in Mexico in 2020 using a set
of 98 Climatic, Social, Economic and Governmental factors as putative causes,
showing that besides the impact of alternative land uses, the models infer an important
role for the *Sembrando Vida* government program.
